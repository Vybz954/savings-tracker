Savings Tracker DApp



This project is a Savings Tracker built on the Stacks blockchain. It enables users to set and track savings goals while leveraging the power of Bitcoin through Stacks.



Features

• A responsive front-end created with React and deployed via v0.

• Users can set custom savings goals and track their progress in STX.

• Built with scalability in mind, with plans to integrate smart contracts for secure, decentralized functionality.



Current Status



This project was developed as part of the NoCodeClarity Hackathon. While incomplete, it includes a functional front-end and significant progress toward integrating the smart contract backend.



Accomplishments:

1. Successfully created and deployed the front-end using v0.

2. Learned the Stacks blockchain development process, including front-end integration and Clarity smart contracts.

3. Overcame numerous challenges while gaining valuable experience with blockchain tools and technologies.



Pending:

• Final deployment of the smart contract for savings goal logic.

• Connection of the front end to the smart contract via Stacks.js.

Learnings and Reflections



This project was a tremendous learning experience. As a beginner in blockchain and smart contracts, I faced many challenges but gained:

• Practical knowledge of Stacks.js, React, and the Stacks blockchain.

• A deeper understanding of full-stack decentralized application development.



Future Goals

1. Complete smart contract deployment and integration.

2. Enhance the user interface and add additional features like progress charts.

3. Deploy a fully functional savings DApp for real-world use.
